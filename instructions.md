# Fish Store

We will be making an entirely underwhelming fish store.
Users will be able to:
  - See all the fish that are available in the store.
  - Apply a filter to see only the fish that are on sale.
  - Add fish to their basket
  - Remove fish from their basket.

 But, here's the fun part ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰: We will be using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to do all of the DOM interaction.
