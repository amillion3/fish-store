# Fish Store

## In this app, we have created a basic fish store. Some fish are priced regularly and some are marked for sale. If the user wishes to only see fish for sale, there is a button they can click.

## Technology
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript/ES6
- jQuery/Bootstrap 3
- Node.JS/Browserify/Grunt
